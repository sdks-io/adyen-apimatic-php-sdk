/**
 * Deducts all transaction fees incurred by the payment from the specified balance account. The
 * transaction fees include the acquiring fees (interchange and scheme fee), and the fees due to Adyen
 * (markup or commission). You can book any and all these fees to different balance account by
 * specifying other transaction fee parameters in your split configuration profile:
 *
 * - [`adyenCommission`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * adyenCommission): The transaction fee due to Adyen under [blended rates](https://www.adyen.
 * com/knowledge-hub/interchange-fees-explained#interchange-vs-blended).
 * - [`adyenMarkup`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * adyenMarkup): The transaction fee due to Adyen under [Interchange ++ pricing](https://www.adyen.
 * com/knowledge-hub/interchange-fees-explained#interchange-vs-blended).
 * - [`schemeFee`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * schemeFee): The fee paid to the card scheme for using their network.
 * - [`interchange`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * interchange): The fee paid to the issuer for each payment transaction made with the card network.
 * - [`adyenFees`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * adyenFees): The aggregated amount of Adyen's commission and markup.
 * - [`acquiringFees`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-
 * explorer/Management/latest/post/merchants/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic-
 * acquiringFees): The aggregated amount of the interchange and scheme fees.
 *
 * If you don't include at least one transaction fee type in the `splitLogic` object, Adyen updates the
 * payment request with the `paymentFee` parameter, booking all transaction fees to your platform's
 * liable balance account.
 *
 * Possible values: **deductFromLiableAccount**, **deductFromOneBalanceAccount**.
