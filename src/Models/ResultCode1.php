/**
 * The result of the payment. For more information, see [Result codes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-
 * payments/payment-result-codes).
 *
 * Possible values:
 *
 * * **AuthenticationFinished** – The payment has been successfully authenticated with 3D Secure 2.
 * Returned for 3D Secure 2 authentication-only transactions.
 * * **AuthenticationNotRequired** – The transaction does not require 3D Secure authentication.
 * Returned for [standalone authentication-only integrations](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/3d-
 * secure/other-3ds-flows/authentication-only).
 * * **Authorised** – The payment was successfully authorised. This state serves as an indicator to
 * proceed with the delivery of goods and services. This is a final state.
 * * **Cancelled** – Indicates the payment has been cancelled (either by the shopper or the merchant)
 * before processing was completed. This is a final state.
 * * **ChallengeShopper** – The issuer requires further shopper interaction before the payment can be
 * authenticated. Returned for 3D Secure 2 transactions.
 * * **Error** – There was an error when the payment was being processed. The reason is given in the
 * `refusalReason` field. This is a final state.
 * * **IdentifyShopper** – The issuer requires the shopper's device fingerprint before the payment can
 * be authenticated. Returned for 3D Secure 2 transactions.
 * * **PartiallyAuthorised** – The payment has been authorised for a partial amount.
 * This happens for card payments when the merchant supports Partial Authorisations and the cardholder
 * has insufficient funds.
 * * **Pending** – Indicates that it is not possible to obtain the final status of the payment. This
 * can happen if the systems providing final status information for the payment are unavailable, or if
 * the shopper needs to take further action to complete the payment.
 * * **PresentToShopper** – Indicates that the response contains additional information that you need
 * to present to a shopper, so that they can use it to complete a payment.
 * * **Received** – Indicates the payment has successfully been received by Adyen, and will be
 * processed. This is the initial state for all payments.
 * * **RedirectShopper** – Indicates the shopper should be redirected to an external web page or app to
 * complete the authorisation.
 * * **Refused** – Indicates the payment was refused. The reason is given in the `refusalReason` field.
 * This is a final state.
