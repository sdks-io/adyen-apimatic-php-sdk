 * The status of the session. The status included in the response doesn't get updated. Don't make the

 *
 * Possible values:
 * * **completed**: the shopper completed the payment, and the payment was authorized.
 * * **paymentPending**: the shopper is in the process of making the payment. This applies to payment
 * methods with an asynchronous flow, like voucher payments where the shopper completes the payment in
 * a physical shop.
 * * **refused**: the session has been refused, because of too many refused payment attempts. The
 * shopper can no longer complete the payment with this session.
 * * **canceled**: the shopper canceled the payment.
 * * **expired**: the session expired. The shopper can no longer complete the payment with this session.
 * By default, the session expires one hour after it is created.
